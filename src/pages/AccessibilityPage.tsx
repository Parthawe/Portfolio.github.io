            <p>
              This document explains how the portfolio is intended to work for keyboard users, screen-reader users,
              people who reduce motion, and visitors who simply need a calmer path through the work.

              <h2>Intent</h2>
              <p>
                This portfolio has a lot of expressive UI: rulers, canvas overlays, 3D objects, motion, cards,
                case-study rails, and experimental interaction tools. The accessibility goal is not to remove that
                personality. The goal is to make sure the expressive layer never blocks the basic job: reading the work,
                opening projects, understanding access limits, and contacting me.
              </p>
              <p>
                The practical standard is WCAG 2.2 AA behavior. That means readable text, visible focus, keyboard access,
                reduced-motion safety, resilient layouts, and meaningful alternatives for non-text media.

              <h2>Interaction model</h2>
              <p>
                Primary navigation is conventional: logo, Work, About, and contact. Category pages and case studies use
                ordinary links first. Optional tools such as grid, ruler, Figma mode, hand controls, and audio do not
                replace the page structure.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                Experimental interactions are allowed to delight, but they should not become the only door into the room.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The page also keeps a skip link and semantic landmarks so a visitor can jump directly to the main content
                without crossing the decorative frame.

              <h2>Media and motion</h2>
              <p>
                Motion is used to show hierarchy and spatial context, but the site should remain legible when motion is
                reduced. Decorative canvases collapse when WebGL is unavailable. Images in project cards and case studies
                need useful alt text when they carry meaning, and empty alt text when they are purely decorative.

                Some portfolio work is access-limited. Those projects are marked before opening, and the public page
                gives only a safe glimpse. That makes the access state understandable for recruiters while keeping
                protected material out of the public static build.

              <p>
                This is an actively changing portfolio, so the risk is drift. Visual polish can weaken contrast, new
                media can miss captions, and new controls can accidentally bypass keyboard users. The next pass should
                make the audit repeatable instead of relying on a manual review.
