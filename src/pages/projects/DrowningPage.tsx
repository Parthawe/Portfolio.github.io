          <CsBody>
            <p>Drowning needed a black-box set that felt sheltering and suffocating at the same time. The abandoned greenhouse gave the production that contradiction: cracked transparency, overgrown life, and a room that seemed to close in as the play progressed.</p>
            <p>The surviving documentation is a scenic model, scene boards, and a film. The model lets the arrangement of figures, vegetation, and architectural frames be studied together.</p>

            <CsBody>
              <p>The set needed to feel protective and suffocating at once. I used abandoned greenhouse references for that tension: cracked transparency, overgrowth, corrosion, and light that never feels fully clean.</p>
              <p>The final direction became a partial enclosure of frosted panels, salvaged frames, and trailing plants. It kept sightlines open while making the room feel like it was slowly closing in.</p>

              <p>The model is arranged in layers: vegetation in front, a greenhouse frame through the middle, and a gridded wall behind. Doorways and gaps keep the figures visible within that enclosure.</p>
              <p>The scene boards use light and shadow to change the emphasis within the same model. They show how a character can become isolated without replacing the architecture.</p>

            <p><strong>Texture carries the atmosphere.</strong> Dense foliage and exposed framing make the same enclosure feel both occupied and abandoned.</p>
            <p><strong>Light changes the focus.</strong> The scene boards test where the audience looks as the relationship between the characters changes.</p>
            <p><strong>The next step is a full-scale test.</strong> Sightlines, performer movement, and the proposed water-like reflections would need to be checked in the performance space.</p>
