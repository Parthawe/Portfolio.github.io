          <CsBody>
            <p>The Dumb Waiter is a one-act play about Ben and Gus, two hitmen trapped in a basement room while they wait for instructions. Nothing dramatic seems to happen at first: they argue, correct each other, fuss over tea, and circle around the question of who their next target will be.</p>
            <p>I designed the room as a polished criminal basement rather than a naturalistic flat. The John Wick reference gave the model a hard visual language: dark walls, a weapons display, warm wood, sharp thresholds, and objects that make ordinary waiting feel choreographed and dangerous.</p>

              <h3 className="cs-section-title">Concept</h3>
              <CsBody>
                <p>The central idea was to make the room feel controlled from above. The dumb waiter is small, but it changes the scale of the entire space: every object becomes evidence that someone unseen is watching, judging, and sending orders down.</p>
                <p>Ben and Gus are not placed in a messy hideout. They are placed inside a clean, curated machine for violence. That contrast lets the comedy of their small talk sit next to the dread of what the room is built to do.</p>

              <CsBody>
                <p>The set is organized around pressure points: the raised stair landing, the sleeping area, the speaking wall, the bathroom door, and the dumb waiter. Each zone gives the actors somewhere to wait, hide, listen, or be cornered.</p>
                <p>The room stays mostly open, but the sightlines are sliced by the stairs and wall openings. From the audience, Ben and Gus can look exposed and trapped at the same time.</p>

              <CsBody>
                <p>The props carry the play's power structure. The beds make the basement domestic, the weapons make it professional, the bathroom makes it humiliating, and the dumb waiter turns a wall opening into command, surveillance, and threat.</p>
                <p>The gramophone, rug, wood shutters, and black surfaces keep the room from becoming a plain basement. They make it feel like a criminal waiting room with taste, ritual, and a little too much control.</p>

              <CsBody>
                <p>The model works as a stage proposal and as a camera object. Wide views show the room as a boxed trap; close views let the audience inspect the little systems of power: the tube, the doorways, the staircase, and the weapons.</p>
                <p>That mattered because the play itself works by withholding. The set had to give the audience enough to read the world, while still keeping the real source of authority outside the frame.</p>

            <CsBody>
              <p><strong>The threat is architectural.</strong> The room matters because the most powerful character never enters it.</p>
              <p><strong>Objects can behave like dialogue.</strong> The dumb waiter, doors, beds, and weapons all ask the same question as the text: who is in control?</p>
              <p><strong>Cinematic references need discipline.</strong> The John Wick tone helped sharpen the room, but Pinter's tension still comes from restraint, silence, and waiting.</p>
