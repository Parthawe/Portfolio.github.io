            <p>This project is best shown as a concept glimpse, not a heavy case study. The starting point was a student persona with curiosity for web development but limited desktop access. I explored how HTML and CSS concepts could be taught on a phone by turning structure into something visual: containers, padding, images, text, and buttons became stackable 3D blocks.</p>
