An alert fires at 3am, you fumble for your laptop, spend twenty minutes finding the right repo, and another forty minutes understanding a stack trace someone else wrote. OnCall Lens eliminates that entire sequence. Sentry detects the error, your smart glasses show the alert, you tap \u201cFix,\u201d and a Claude-powered agent spins up a Daytona workspace, writes a patch, gets it reviewed by CodeRabbit, and opens a PR \u2014 all before you finish your coffee.',

          <CsBody>
                <p>Every on-call engineer knows the feeling: an alert arrives at the worst possible time, and the first minutes are spent rebuilding context. OnCall Lens asks what happens if triage, AI patching, and approval can start from a glance.</p>
            <p>The tools have improved. Sentry surfaces rich stack traces, PagerDuty routes alerts intelligently, Slack threads keep context. But the fundamental loop has not changed: a human gets woken up, opens a computer, reads a wall of text, and manually writes a patch. The human is the bottleneck at every step.</p>

        <CsSection id="cs-bet" label="The Bet" title="What If the First Responder Was an AI Agent?">
          <CsBody>
            <p>The thesis behind OnCall Lens is a simple inversion: instead of paging a human to debug and fix, page an AI agent to debug and fix &mdash; and page the human only to approve. The engineer becomes the decision-maker, not the debugger. They glance at their glasses, see a one-line summary of the error and the proposed fix, and tap &ldquo;Approve&rdquo; or &ldquo;Reject.&rdquo; That is the entire interaction.</p>
            <p>This is not about replacing engineers. It is about respecting their time and sleep. The AI agent does the mechanical work &mdash; reading stack traces, finding the relevant code, writing a patch, running tests. The human does what humans are best at: deciding whether this fix is correct and whether it should ship.</p>
            <p>Smart glasses are the perfect interface for this. You do not need a laptop to approve a PR. You need three seconds of attention and a single tap.</p>

            <p>Building OnCall Lens at a hackathon meant every design decision had to be made fast and right. There was no time for user research, no room for iteration cycles, and no luxury of polishing what did not work. These were the three constraints that shaped every choice.</p>

            <p>The glasses notification flow is the heart of OnCall Lens. It is the interface between a production incident and a human decision.

          <CsNumList items={[
            <><strong>Urgency compresses design to its essentials.</strong> When the user is an engineer woken up at 3am, every extra word, every unnecessary screen, every ambiguous icon is a failure. Designing for on-call stripped my work down to the absolute minimum viable information: what broke, how bad, what do you want to do about it. That discipline carries into everything I design now.</>,
            <><strong>AI agents need transparent reasoning, not just correct outputs.</strong> Engineers will not trust a black-box fix on a production system. The step-by-step pipeline view &mdash; showing what Claude found, what it changed, and why &mdash; was not a nice-to-have. It was the feature that made the entire product usable. Trust is built through visibility.</>,
            <><strong>Smart glasses are the right interface for interrupt-driven work.</strong> On-call is inherently an interrupt. You are doing something else, and then you are not. A laptop requires context-switching to an entirely different device and mental mode. Glasses let you stay in your current context and handle the interrupt with a glance and a tap. The form factor matches the task.</>,
