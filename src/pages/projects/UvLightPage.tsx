            <CsBody>
              <p>The piece asked what changes when the important information is present, but not visible yet. Blacklight and invisible ink made that delay physical.</p>
              <p>Under normal light, the room felt harmless. Under UV, a second layer appeared, turning discovery into a question about observation and surveillance.</p>
              <p>I shaped the concept, room sequence, UV logic, participant flow, and live execution.</p>

            <CsBody>
              <p>The research pushed the work toward participatory theater, where curiosity and social cues guide people better than instructions.</p>
              <p>UV also behaved differently on paper, tape, clothes, skin, and walls. That unpredictability made the room feel alive instead of decorated.</p>

            <CsBody>
              <p>The risk was explaining too fast. I tested inks, paints, tape, and lighting until the clues felt discoverable without feeling scripted.</p>
              <p>The camera-feed layer worked because it arrived after people had relaxed into play. The room first invited them in, then revealed they were being watched.</p>
